## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance for Hiring Managers

This application includes a **comprehensive test suite with 53 tests** demonstrating professional testing practices:

### Unit & Integration Test Coverage
- **🔧 Utility Functions**: 32 tests covering `skill-matching.ts` with edge cases, regex handling, and special characters (C++, C#)
- **🌐 API Routes**: 21 tests for `/analyze-skills` and `/generate-resume` endpoints with full error handling
- **📊 Ground Truth Validation**: All tests use real candidate data from `data.json` for realistic scenarios
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Comprehensive testing of API failures, JSON parsing errors, and malformed inputs

### Testing Highlights
```bash
npm test
# ✅ 53 tests passing across 3 test suites
# ✅ 100% pass rate with comprehensive mocking
# ✅ Found and fixed critical bugs during test development
```

**Test-Driven Development**: During testing, we discovered and fixed several critical bugs in the source code, including:
- Skill variation generation creating invalid duplicates
- Partial word matching issues (reactive vs react)
- Nested HTML tag problems in text highlighting

### Full Integration Testing with Tilt
Complete end-to-end functionality has been validated through **Tilt** ([whytilt.com](https://whytilt.com)), a Vision/Action model I developed for semantic usability and functional testing. Unlike traditional headless testing that fights with ever-changing DOM structures, Tilt performs true semantic testing by understanding and interacting with websites exactly like a human user would - no brittle selectors or element hunting required. This represents simulation testing at its finest, providing confidence that all user workflows function perfectly in real-world scenarios.

## 🏆 Built in One Day with Claude Code

This entire application was built from scratch in a single day using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), demonstrating the powerful synergy between AI pair programming and experienced developers. The rapid development was made possible by:

- **AI-Augmented Development**: Leveraging Claude Code for intelligent code generation and problem-solving
- **Developer Expertise**: 10+ years of React experience guiding architectural decisions and best practices
- **Iterative Refinement**: Real-time collaboration between human creativity and AI capabilities
- **Modern Tooling**: Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS enabling rapid, type-safe development

This project showcases how experienced developers can leverage AI tools to dramatically accelerate development while maintaining production-quality code standards.

## 🚀 Key Features

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### Skill Matching & Bolding
The application implements intelligent skill matching with variations handling:
```typescript
// Handles variations like "React.js" vs "React" vs "ReactJS"
const skillVariations = [
  skill,
  skill.replace(/\.js$/i, ''),
  skill.replace(/\.js$/i, 'JS'),
  skill + '.js',
  skill + 'JS'
];
```

### Optimistic UI Updates
Skills are added instantly in the UI while the API call happens in the background:
```typescript
// Immediate UI update
setSkillGapReport({
  ...skillGapReport,
  missingSkills: skillGapReport.missingSkills.filter(s => s !== skill),
  matchingSkills: [...skillGapReport.matchingSkills, skill]
});

// Background API call with error handling
const response = await fetch('/api/add-skill', {...});
```

### Professional Document Formatting
- Clean, ATS-friendly layout
- Consistent typography using Inter font
- Section dividers at 88% width for visual separation
- Two-page support with proper page breaks
- Skills bolding in summary, skills section, and work experience

## 📝 Customizing Your Resume Data

### Quick Start: Building Your Own Resume

To create your own tailored resumes and cover letters, you'll need to update the `data.json` file with your personal information. This file serves as your resume database that the AI uses to generate documents.

### Step-by-Step Data Customization

1. **Personal Information** - Update your basic contact details:
```json
{
  "personalInfo": {
    "name": "Your Full Name",
    "phone": "(555) 123-4567", 
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "location": "Your City, State",
    "github": "https://github.com/yourusername",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername",
    "title": "Your Professional Title"
  }
}
```

2. **Skills** - Add your technical and professional skills organized by category:
```json
{
  "skills": {
    "languages": [
      {"name": "JavaScript", "years": "5"},
      {"name": "Python", "years": 3}
    ],
    "frontend": [
      {"name": "React.js", "years": "4"},
      {"name": "Vue.js", "years": 2}
    ],
    "backend": [...],
    "databases": [...],
    "tools": [...],
    "specialties": [...]
  }
}
```

3. **Work Experience** - List your professional experience:
```json
{
  "experience": [
    {
      "role": "Software Engineer",
      "company": "Company Name",
      "location": "City, State", 
      "startDate": "2020",
      "endDate": "Present",
      "achievements": [
        "Built responsive web applications using React and TypeScript",
        "Improved application performance by 40% through code optimization",
        "Led a team of 3 developers on key product features"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **Education** - Add your educational background:
```json
{
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science",
      "institution": "University Name",
      "location": "City, State",
      "graduationDate": "2020",
      "coursework": ["Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Web Development"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pro Tips for Best Results

- **Be Specific**: Include exact years of experience and specific technologies
- **Use Industry Terms**: Match common job posting terminology
- **Quantify Achievements**: Include numbers, percentages, and measurable outcomes
- **Keep It Truthful**: The AI will only use what you provide - no fabrication
- **Organize Skills**: Group similar skills together for better matching

### Data Privacy

Your personal `data.json` is yours to customize. The repository includes an anonymized example with placeholder data to protect privacy while demonstrating functionality.

## 🔧 Configuration

### AI Behavior Customization
The AI prompts can be customized in the API routes to adjust generation behavior:
- Enforce specific formatting rules
- Add industry-specific requirements
- Adjust tone and style

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why HTML-to-PDF over React PDF?
After extensive testing, we chose Puppeteer-based HTML-to-PDF generation because:
- Better control over formatting and page breaks
- Consistent rendering across different environments
- Easier to debug and style with standard CSS
- Native text selection in generated PDFs

### Two-Stage Workflow
The analyze → generate workflow ensures users:
1. See what skills they're missing before generating documents
2. Can add missing skills instantly
3. Have full control over the generation process

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- **No Data Fabrication**: The AI is strictly instructed to use only provided information
- **Environment Variables**: API keys are never exposed in the codebase
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the application

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel API Calls**: Resume and cover letter generate simultaneously
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback for better UX
- **Efficient Re-renders**: React state updates are batched when possible
- **Build Optimization**: Next.js automatic code splitting and lazy loading
